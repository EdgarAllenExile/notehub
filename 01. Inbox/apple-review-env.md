# Apple Reviews

When Apple does reviews of an Application that is to be deployed through the app store, they want:

- To be able to accessthe app
- To poke around in some way

## Our Solution

Or current solution is to enable this by creating a lightweight API in a seperate AD that will host both versions of the app.
