# Maui Shapes & Esri Shapes

Maui.Contols.Polygons, polygons are composed of a collection of points, the PointsCollection. 

If we are going to translate those into an esri polygon, we will just need to turn the point into a map point.

I am not totally sure what the point to MapPoint conversion is like, but I am sure we can work it out.
