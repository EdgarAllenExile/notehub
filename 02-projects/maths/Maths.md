# Common Maths Things that I should Know (as an engineer lol)
## Basic Words and Definitions 
- Exponent; the number that something is taken to the power of. x in 'y to the power of x'.



## Logarithm
A logarithim is the amoount of times you need to exponate (to the power of) something to reach a desired value. Put in a more mathematical way, the logarithim of a number x, to the base b, is the exponent to which b must be raised to produce x.

So the logarithim for 10 to 1000 is 3. b is 10, x is 1000 and the exponent is 3. 1000=10^3.

NB the graph for a logarithm uses the exponent on the y axis and the result (x above) on the x.

Not totally sure why they think this is called the inverse function of the power of two function. 

### Relationship with Power of Two
Binary logarithms are referred to as the inverse function to the power of two. This must be because they track similar things but are concerned with the inverse values. 

### Different Logarithms
In different applications, different logarithms are used as the assumed. 
- The most common logarithim is base 10 and is called  the decimal or common logarithim.
- The natural logarithm is e=2.718, which apparently has lots of derivatives.
- Computer science is assumed to use base 2. This is called the Binary Logarithm.

How should I go about actually writing maths things? Is Latex actually that good?
