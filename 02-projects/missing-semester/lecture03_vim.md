# VIM

Obviously this is less dense with information. I am not terrible at VIM.

There are two types of visual mode, visual line mode and visual block mode - possibly actually a third being just regular visual mode.

- v, V and then viual block mode shortcut.

Double pressing a command will do that command for the entire line. Such as dd deleting the entire line

Capital Letter Motions, W/B/E travel to the next white space character, whereas lowercase w/b/e travel to the next non-alphabet letter.

`:help w` shows help for the w motion
`:help :w` shows help for `:w(rite)`

:qq quits all open windows

^ goes to the first non-empty char on a line, 0 goes to first and $ goes to last.

l/m/h are supposed to navigate around the page, being lowest middle and highest part of the page. But doesn't seem to work for me.

f finds next instance of character, F does same but backwards.

t does the same as f but puts you one char before.

. redo most recent command. Elite.

a/i are around and inside and are elite for brackets or inverted commas.

## Visual Mode

Entering visual mode lets you move around and select text. From there you can really do whatever you would like with it.

v for visual mode, V for visual line mode.
