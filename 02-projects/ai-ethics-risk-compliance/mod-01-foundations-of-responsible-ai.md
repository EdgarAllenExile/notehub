# Foundations of Responsible Ai

## What is AI

> [!NOTE]
> Engineered system that generates outputs such as forecasts, recommendations and decisions.

Narrow AI; better than us, but only in the one task. Faster at research, but not at accurate.

General AI; at parity with us.

Super AI; better than us in every way.

## Resonsible AI

### Opportunities

Trust and adoption, fairness and inclusion, compliance and governance, innovation and human centered design.

### Risks

Bias and descrimination, lack of accountability, privacy violations, misinformation and manipulation, loss of human agency.

## Core Ethical Principals

Aus Ai principals, OICD, ISO42001 and EU guidelines, basically boil down to:

- Human centred values
- Human oversight
- Transparency and explainability
- Privacy protection and security
- Reliability and safety
- Societal and environmental wellbeing
- Fairness
- Accountability

### Transparency and Explainability

Decisions made by AI should be disclosed, explainable and appealable.

### Accountability

In the event of the AI making a poor decision, there should be a direct line of accountability.
