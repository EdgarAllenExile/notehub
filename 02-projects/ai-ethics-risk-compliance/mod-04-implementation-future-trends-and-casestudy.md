# Implementation, Future Trends & Case Study

## Implementation Overview

Steps are:

    1. Leadership buy in; are senior leadership onboard?
    2. Business use AI; how will the business use AI? How does the business work?
    3. AI risks; What are the risks of using AI? How will those risks be addressed?
    4. Resources; Are the right resources available?

## AIMS

AI Management Systems, or AIMS, are a measured system that controls various wider bsiness implications of using AI.

ISO 42001 is a useful approach to such an endevour because it:

- Improves risk managment
- Helps ensure compliance obligations are met
- Demonstrates responsible, ethical and trustworthy use of AI
- Is certifiable / internationally recognised
- Can fit in with existing ISO standards to create Integrated Management Systems or IMS

## Case Study

    1. Identify stakeholders
    2. Identify Risk tollerance
    2.1 Applicable laws
    2.2 Relevant data implications
    3. Identify AI-related implementations and activities undertaken

Use the above to set the scope statement of your AIMS, what to include / exclude to have the auditor review and certify.

### Risks

#### Risk Managmenet

The internal team should go through the risks available, assess their impact and liklihood. Use this to create a risk register of individual risk items.

#### Risk Treatment

Once you have a good overview of the risks, you can start looking at the controls available in ISO 42001 and apply them to the relevant risks. You can effectively marry the listed risk to the potential control and how it has been implemented. You are effectively instantiating the control within the context of your risks and wider org.

## Future Trends

We are seeing the following emerging trends in AI and GRC:

- AI is becoming a core pillar in GRC
- Predictive risk modeling
- Integration of AI within GRC platforms
- AI driven compliance modeling
- Integrated approaches, AI in cyber / quality and vise versa


AI is becoming a core pillar of GRC, less around AI as the source of requirements, but rather how AI systems are referenced in other places. *Privacy Act* refereincing data managment and how that is used in AI.

Predictive risk modeling is improving quantative risk assessments. ML can be used to predictions etc.
