# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns deal with how classes and objects fit in to the larger structures within a program.

Common structural design patterns include:

- Adapter pattern
- Bridge pattern
- Composite pattern
- Decorator pattern
- Facade pattern
- Proxy pattern
- Flyweight pattern

## Adapter pattern

An adapter pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

An adapter is a special object that converts the interface of one object so that annother interface can understand it. This can be useful in situations in which legacy parts of programs have been imported and still need to be used.

Can also be used when you would like to reuse classes or components with interfaces that are incompatible with the interfaces expected by the existing code.

Can also act as a bridge for making different interfaces work together correctly, can be especially helpful when using imported third party APIs or libraries which present with different inerfaces than the existing ones on the system.

### Implementation

There are four major components required for an adapter pattern:

1. Target interface. The interface used by the Client and represents the set of operations that the client code can use.
   1. It acts as the common interface that the client code interacts with
2. Adaptee. The existing class or system with an incompatible interface that must be implemented
   1. It acts as the class or system that the client code would like to use but cannot due to interface mismatch.
3. Adaptor. A class that implements the target interface and internally uses an instance of the adaptee to make compatible.
   1. It acts as the bridge adapting the interface of the adaptee to match the target interface.
4. Client. The code that will use the target interface to interact with objects.
   1. It is the code that benefits from the integration of the adaptee into the system through the adapter.

When it gets down to it, the design pattern follows four man steps:

1. Client request is initiated by calling a method on the adapter using the target interface
2. The adaptor translates or maps the client's request into a form that the adaptee understands, using the adaptee's interface
3. The adaptee performs the actual work based on the translated reques from the adapter
4. The client receives the results of the call, remaining agnostic to the adapters presence or the specifics of the adaptee

#### Example

```


// Adapter Design Pattern Example Code
 
#include <iostream>
 
// Target Interface
class Printer {
public:
    virtual void print() = 0;
};
 
// Adaptee
class LegacyPrinter {
public:
    void printDocument() {
        std::cout << "Legacy Printer is printing a document." << std::endl;
    }
};
 
// Adapter
class PrinterAdapter : public Printer {
private:
    LegacyPrinter legacyPrinter;
 
public:
    void print() override {
        legacyPrinter.printDocument();
    }
};
 
// Client Code
void clientCode(Printer& printer) {
    printer.print();
}
 
int main() {
    // Using the Adapter
    PrinterAdapter adapter;
    clientCode(adapter);
 
    return 0;
}
```

The expected output of this code would be "Legacy Printer is printing a document."

## Bridge pattern

Similar to an adapter in intent, the bridge pattern seperates an abstraction from its implementation. This can promote loose coupling between class abstractions and implementations.

There are two parts to a Bridge design pattern abstraction and implementation.

- The bridge pattern allows both of these parts to be developed independantly of each other. The client code only needs to access the abstraction portion of the code without concerning itself with the implementation.
- The abstraction is done in an interface or abstract class, with the implementor also being an interface or class.
- The abstraction contains a reference to the implementor. Children of the abstraction are referred to as refined abstractions. Children of the implementer are concrete abstractions.

You should use a bridge pattern because:

- It decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independantly
- You are developing a platform independant feature
- Lets you stick an abstraction interface in

### Implementation

There are four elements involved when using a bridge pattern.

1. Abstraction. This is the core of the bridge pattern and defines the crux. Contains a reference to the implementor.
2. Refined abstraction. Extends the abstraction and digs into the finer details. Hides those details from the implementors.
3. Implementor. Defines the interface for the implememtation classes. Does not need to correspond directly to the abstraction interface and can be very different.
4. Concrete implementor. Implements the above implementor by providing the concrete implementor.

#### Example

```
// Java code to demonstrate
// bridge design pattern

// abstraction in bridge pattern
abstract class Vehicle {
	protected Workshop workShop1;
	protected Workshop workShop2;

	protected Vehicle(Workshop workShop1, Workshop workShop2)
	{
		this.workShop1 = workShop1;
		this.workShop2 = workShop2;
	}

	abstract public void manufacture();
}

// Refine abstraction 1 in bridge pattern
class Car extends Vehicle {
	public Car(Workshop workShop1, Workshop workShop2)
	{
		super(workShop1, workShop2);
	}

	@Override
	public void manufacture()
	{
		System.out.print("Car ");
		workShop1.work();
		workShop2.work();
	}
}

// Refine abstraction 2 in bridge pattern
class Bike extends Vehicle {
	public Bike(Workshop workShop1, Workshop workShop2)
	{
		super(workShop1, workShop2);
	}

	@Override
	public void manufacture()
	{
		System.out.print("Bike ");
		workShop1.work();
		workShop2.work();
	}
}

// Implementer for bridge pattern
interface Workshop
{
	abstract public void work();
}

// Concrete implementation 1 for bridge pattern
class Produce implements Workshop {
	@Override
	public void work()
	{
		System.out.print("Produced");
	}
}

// Concrete implementation 2 for bridge pattern
class Assemble implements Workshop {
	@Override
	public void work()
	{
		System.out.print(" And");
		System.out.println(" Assembled.");
	}
}

// Demonstration of bridge design pattern
class BridgePattern {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Vehicle vehicle1 = new Car(new Produce(), new Assemble());
		vehicle1.manufacture();
		Vehicle vehicle2 = new Bike(new Produce(), new Assemble());
		vehicle2.manufacture();
	}
}

```

The expected output of the above would be :

Car Produced And Assembled.

Bike Produced And Assembled.

## Composite pattern

The composite patterns lets you compose objects into tree-like structures that represent "part-whole hierarchies". It allows clients to treat individual objects and the compositions of objects uniformly. It lets clients deal with objects or collections of objects in the same way.

There are four main parts of a composite design pattern:

1. The Component. This declares the interface for the objects within the composition for accessing and managing its child components. Acts as a blueprint that informs what both the individual items and groups of items should do and what they have in commmon.
2. The Leaf. This defines behaviour for primitive objects in the composition. It is the basic building block that represents the individual objects within the compsite. They implement the operations defined by the component interface
3. The Composite. This stores child components and implements child-related operations in the component interface. It is a class that has child components, either leaf or other composites. It implements the component interface, often through delegating the operations to its child components.
4. The Client. The client manipulates objects in the compositon through the component interface. The client uses the component class interface to interact with objects in the composition structure. If that object is a leaf then the request is handled directly, if it is a composite then it  is usually forwarded on to the child component.

Use the composite pattern with tree shaped object structure. Simple leaves and complex containers. The tree metaphore arises because containers can be composed of leaves and other containers, giving a nice recursively nested object structure.

Also useful when you want the client code to treat both simple and complex elements uniformly.


### Implementation

1. Make sure that the core model of the application can be represented as a tree structure. Breakdown into simple elements and containers.
2. Declare the component interface with a list of methods that make sense for both simple and complex components.
3. Create a leaf class to represent simple elements, there can be muliple leaf classes.
4. Create a container class to represent complex elements. Store these elements in an array that can handle leaves and containers, so should be component interface type.
5. Declare the methods of the component interface, the container should delegate most of the work to the sub-elements.


## Decorator pattern

The decorator pattern lets you attach new behaviours to objects by placing those objects inside a special wrapper that contains those behaviour. This is useful to extend classes, without needing to add new subclasses, which would create bloat. Instead, you can use the same base class and add a decorator to effectively act as subclass.

A decorator is even better than extending the intial class becaues inheritance of objects are static and are cannnot be altered post-runtime. Additionally, subclasses cannot inherit from multiple classes. 

You should consider using a decorator when you would like to assign additional behaviour to an object at runitime, without altering the code that uses the object, or when it would be annoying to extend the object's behaviour using inheritance.


### Implementation

1. Ensure that the business domain can be represented as a primary component with many optional layers.
2. Create a component interface that declares the methods common to both the primary and optional layers.
3. Create a concrete component class and define the base behaviours
4. Create a base decorator class that has a field for storing the reference to the wrapped object. The Field should be declared with the component interface to allow linking of concrete components and decorators. This class must delegate all work to the wrapped object.
5. Make sure all classes implement the component interface.
6. Create concrete decorators by extending them from the base decorator. A concrete decorator must execute its behaviour befor or after the call to the parent method.
7. The client code must be responsible for creating decorators and composing them in the way that the client code needs.


## Facade pattern

A facade provides a simplified interface to a library, framework or other set of classes.

It is class that might only provide a limited selection of functions, as opposed to working with the subsystem directly, but it only includes the features that the client needs. It is useful for condensing a large library down into only the parts you need.

You should consider using the facade pattern when you have a limited interface to a complex subsystem. The facade can act as a shortcut to get to the juicy bits.

Also useful if you want to stratify an existing structure. The facade can define entry points into different levels of the subsystem.


### Implementation

1. Determine if it is possible to provide a simpler interface than what exists.
2. Declare and implement this interface in a new facade class. This should redirect calls from the client code to the appropriate objects of the subclass.
3. Make sure all of the client code communicates with the subsystem, only through use of the facade. This will protect the client code from any changes in the subsystem code.

## Proxy pattern

A proxy is a structural design pattern that provides a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets to the original object.

This seems to have a wide range of applicability:

- Lazy initialisation
- Access control
- Local execution of a remote service
- Logging requests
- Caching results
- Smart reference

### Implementation

1. Create an interface to make and proxy service objects interchangably. Alternatively, make the proxy a subclass of the service class, in whichcase it will inherit the interface of the service.
2. Create the proxy class. It must posess fields for storing the reference to the service, usually also will create and manage the whole lifecycle of thier services.
3. Implement the proxy methods according to their purposes. In most cases, after some work, the proxy should delegate work to the service object.
4. It is possible to implement a creation method that decides whether the client gets a proxy or a real service.

## Flyweight pattern

A flyweight is a structural pattern that lets you fit more objects into memory, by sharing common states between objects, as opposed to keeping all of the data in each object.

This is kind of like relational databases. You only keep the unique information within each object and then reference all of the repeating info.

Flyweight patterns should be used when your progam will generate a huge amount of objects and they may all struggle to fit into RAM.

### Implementation

1. Divide fields of a class that will become a flyweight into:
   * Intrinsic state. The fields that contain unchanging data duplicated across many objects
   * Extrinsic state. The fields that contain contextual data unique to each object
2. Leave the intrinsic state in the class, but make immutable. They should take their initial values only inside the constructor.
3. Go over methods that use fields of the extrinsic state. For each field used in the method, introduce a new parameter and use it instead of the field.
4. Optionally, create a factory class to manage the pool of flyweights. It should check for an existing flyweight before creating a new one. Once the factory is in place, clients must only request flyweights through it. They should describe the desired flyweight by passing its intrinsic state to the factory.
5. The client must store or calculate values of the extrinsic state (context) to be able to call methods of flyweight objects. For the sake of convenience, the extrinsic state along with the flyweight-referencing field may be moved to a separate context class.
