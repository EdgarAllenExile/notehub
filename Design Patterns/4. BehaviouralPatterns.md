# Behavioural Design Patterns

Behavioural design patterns are concerned with algorithims and the sharing of responsibility between objects.

In many situations, behavioural patterns involve transforming logic processes into standalone objects called handlers.

Common behavioural design patterns include:

- Observer pattern
- Strategy pattern
- State pattern
- Command pattern
- Chain of responsibility
- Template pattern
- Interpreter pattern
- Visitor pattern
- Mediator pattern
- Momento pattern

## Chain of responsibility

The chain of responsibility pattern is a pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler will decide to either process the request of to pass it to the next handler.

This allows you to perform checks and balances in sequence. As an example: Is a user logged in -> Is this user an admin -> ...

This entails transforming individual behaviours into standalone objects called handlers. Each check should be its own class with a singular method that performs the check. The request, along with the data is passed to this method as an argument.

In this pattern, each handler has a field for storing the reference to the next handler. In addition, you can also break from the pattern early and stop any further processing. There are also variants of this approach in which handlers will pass requests along until one of them decides that they can process the request and then it will exit there.

A chain of responsibility pattern should be used when:

1. A program is expected to process different kinds of requests in various ways, but the types of requests and their sequence is unknown.
2. It is essential to execute handlers in a particular order.
3. Checking and setting is required to be dynamic.

### Implementation

In this set up, the handler class must implement the same interface. Each concrete handler should only care about having the one execute method. This way you can compile the handlers at run time and not have them tied to their concrete classes.

Actual implementation should look something like this:

1. Declare the handler interface and describe the signature of the method for handling requests.
   1. You should also decide how the client will pass requests into the method. This is commonly done through converting the request into an object and passing that to the handling method as an argument.
2. It may be worth creating an abstract base class, derived from the handler interface.
   1. This base class should house the "go next" reference. Implementing the base class will cut down on repreated code.
3. Create the concrete handler subclasses and implement their methods. Each handler should decide to process the request and decide to pass the request along.
4. It may be a good idea to build a factory class to build the chain of handlers.
5. Chains should be dynamic. So:
   1. The Client can choose to trigger any handler in the chain, not only the first.
   2. The request may not actually reach the end of the chain
   3. Requests may reach the end of the chain unhandled
