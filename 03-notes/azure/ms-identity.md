## Public Clients & Redirect URL

You need to provide a redirect URL so your client knows where to listen to for the token being returend.

If you are using a system browser then this is just local host. If you are using an embedded browser then you need to pass in a proper redirect URL, which I think is one of those system linked URLs.
