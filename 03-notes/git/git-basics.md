# Git

## git pull --rebase

Git pull rebase will pull local changes and then commit your change on top of it. It is kinda like what you think git pull should do, where as it actually creates a merge commit first.

## git commit -am "xxx"

Automatically adds all outstanding changes and commits. Combination of git add . and git commit -m "xxx".

## git stash

git stash takes uncommited changes and 'stashes' them away for later use. This reverts them from your working copy.

git stash pop will then reapply your most recent stash to your working branch.
