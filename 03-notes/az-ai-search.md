## Searchable vs Simple Field
SimpleField is non-searchable, but retrievable. You can use it for either the document Id, or filterable, sortable, facetable fields, or to assist scoring profiles. SearchableField is searchable and retrievable, and must be a string. With searchable fields you can define custom analyzers, and use synonym maps.
