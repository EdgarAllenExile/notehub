# Relational vs Non-Relational DBs

## NoSQL

NoSQL dbs do not normalise data, they are closer to storing 'document' data because you can just stick everthing in a big old blob and call it a day.

## SQL

Standard Relational Dbs offer utility because they are great for transactional dbs.

## Choosing Between the Two

Factors to consider are:

- What data are you storing?
- How are you going to query that data?
- What are you going to use that data for?
- Does the schema need to be flexible?

If you think of NoSQL dbs like document stores then it might make sense. If you owould want to store things in a big old file system, then you might want a NoSQL db.
