# Regression Testing

Regression testing is rerunning test functions to ensure that recent updates have not impacted existing features.

There are four main strategies for regression testing:

1. Select all test cases, simple and safe but not overly efficient,
2. Select test cases randomly, cannot ever be the right answer,
3. Select modicication traversing test cases, only test the modified portions of code,
4. Select high priority test cases, test only the important things.
