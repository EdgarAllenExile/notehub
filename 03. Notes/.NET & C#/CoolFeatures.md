### Method Summaries

You can implement custom mouse over tooltips in the method body. First, after the signature, put three reverse-solidus then summary in HTML tags. Anything between these tags will appear in the mouse over tool tip.

Example as follows:

```
        public const string Comments = "api/incidents/comments";
        /// <summary>
        /// GET: Current User's PD Number from Context of Request.
        /// </summary>
```
