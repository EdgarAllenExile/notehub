# C# Nulls

If you would like an easy way for functions to return null, just stick a questionmark after the type like you would if you were otherwise defining a type, you silly goose.

Hence, in the thing you want to do tomorrow, you should define the function as "Pin?" or possibly Graphics? but I think probably pin.

This would be called a null return reference, or an NRT.
