# Building Abstractions With Data

## Introduction

We have previously looked at how primitive data (numbers) and primitive operations (arithmetic) can be used and combined to do some fancy things.

Conducting logical reasoning by way of computational process is the essence of programming.

> [!NOTE]
> Data abstraction is the process of isolating the parts of a program that deal with how data objects are represented, from those that deal with how data objects are used.

The advantages of data abstraction is that it allows different procedures to apply irraspective of what the parameters of that procedure are. 

### Quickfire Notes

- Closure, the idea that data objects should be allowed to combine primative data types and also additional compound data types.
- Symbolic expression, data whose elementary parts are symbols and no numbers.
- Generic operations, those which take no set type.
- Data sentic programing, which is a technique that allows for individual data representations to be creatd seperately and added together.
