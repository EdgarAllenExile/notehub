The world has too many bible salesmen. Keep computer programming fun.

## Elements of Programming
Language is very important for how we describe the actions a computer is performing. 
- Primitive expressions, represent the simplest entities that a language is concerned with
- Means of combination, by which compound elements are build from simpler ones
- Means of abstraction, how we deal with those compound elements and manipulate them as units

A primitive expression would be a number, adding those numbers together is a means of combination and defining that as a function is abstraction.

In mathematic expression, the symbol is the operator and the numbers are the operands.

Recursion at its most simple is a process of evaluation that involves the function calling itself.

A compound procedure differs from a primitive procedure because you first must define the procedure, and then use it. If you define a function that squares a number, this will constitute a compound procedure. This is true even if when you go to call this procedure, it does not differ in form to a primitive procedure. The only way to distinguish them at this stage is to know that this is beyond the scope of the functions built into the interpretter. Such as + _ *.

## Models of Procedure evaluation
There are several different ways to evaluate procedures.

The two easiest ways to think about it are substitution and the other one

### Substitution
It can be easiest to think of substitution method as replacing each formal parameter by its corresponding argument from the outset.
- This can be thought of as evaluating the meaning of a method, in so far as procedures can have meaning."
