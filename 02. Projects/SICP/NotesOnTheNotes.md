I think I am going to need to come back to dthe sections on exponents / exponants? later on. Particularly exercises 1.16 and following were causing me some trouble and I would like to review them with the benefit of a lecture to watch first.

Additionally, I might review the lecture notes found here : https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/teaching/discrete_math_fall_2005/dmbook.pdf
These are mathematically focused, but could definitely give me a little headsstart on the Mathematics for Computer Programers portion of Teach Yourself Computer Science.


I have actually decided that I am not sure if I need to do the additional exercises. The maths part is what I am most tripped up by, and we are not up to the Maths portion of this 'course'.
