## Code Completions and Visual Studio Plugins

I think I have CoPilot installed natively, because that's what comes with VSc.

I have also tried installing Windsurf because honestly they have an nvim plug in and that sounds pretty good.

Things to look at:

- Local only
- Make sure only intended plugin is enabled
