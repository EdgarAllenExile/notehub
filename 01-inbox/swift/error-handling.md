# Swift Error Handling

Since we have updated the syntax of .value and similar (now) deprecated methods, we are required to insert some async handling.

A condequence of this, is that we now also need to include some error handling and try catch blocks. 

There are not nearly enough curlies in and around this language for my own personal enjoyment.
