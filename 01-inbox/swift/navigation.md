# Navigation

The thing that you had fucked up is that swift navigation is built on a nav stack, you cannot have multiple stacks else everything falls apart.

How precisely a nav stack differs from a nav view is honestly anyones guess.

Also pushing a build from Local to TestFlight / Apple Connect also is both really easy and surprising.
