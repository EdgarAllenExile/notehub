# Shell Scripts

Random tid bits that I have learned whilst making git commands

- the file extension for shell commands actually does not matter.
  - .sh or .zsh makes no difference.
- It's actually controlled by the shebang.
  - a shebang is a command at the top of a script that tells the computer which interpretter to use when executing the script.
  - For zsh it looks somethign like this:
   - `#!/bin/zsh`
