# buffers vs windows vs tabs

Brief overview is as follows:

- A buffer is the in memory content of a file,
- A window is a viewport of a buffer, and
- A tab page is a collection of windows.

Thus you can open multiple windows of the same buffer, but they are likely to all be contianed within the one tab page. If you open a virt split on a single buffer, that is one buffer, two windows and one tab.
