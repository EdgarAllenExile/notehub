# Podman

Podman is a similar container style tool, however it is daemon-less and also does not have the same problems as that pesky docker desktop (consuming all resources (oh and also being subject to agreements))

## Set Up

Have WSL2 installed, actually not even a requirement, it'll do this for you

## Installing Podman

The Podman for Desktop install should get you most of the way there. Can just install Podman through winget and then configure from there

## Configuration

### Configuring Podman

I just run that shit on default thus far

### Configuring other tools

If using VS Code, simply hit the little settings thing and then toggle to podman

## Advanced Configuration

### Networking

I am actually going to give this its own little page I think
