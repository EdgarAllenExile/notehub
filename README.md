Riley's nerd notes, in Markdown.

## Recommended Plugins & Tools

- render-markdown
  - .md renderer for nvim.
- cweijan.vscode-office
  - Let's you work with .md files in a nice WYSIWYG editor. Apparently also lets you edit Word and Excel files, but I (bravely) use Word and Excel for that.

## Resources I should review

- Personal notes from Missing Semester talks
- That one bloke's examples from interfaces vs classes vs objects

## Things that I need to learn more about

* [ ] What is a Vim Buffer
* [ ] How should I best go about opening a workspace or similar
* [ ] Why have I not included anything in here that is not VIM related.
* [ ] Use cases for different types, like enums and structs
* [ ] Different flags that can be applied to classes - static, ref, etc

## Things to experiment with
* [ ] Code snippets for markdown, similar to this: https://mambusskruj.github.io/posts/pub-neovim-for-markdown/
* [ ] Also play with markdown.nvim (although I think I have this one installed nativelly) : https://neovimcraft.com/plugin/tadmccorkle/markdown.nvim/
