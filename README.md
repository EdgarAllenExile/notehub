Riley's nerd notes, in Markdown.

## Recommended VSc Plugins

- cweijan.vscode-office
  - Let's you work with .md files in a nice WYSIWYG editor. Apparently also lets you edit Word and Excel files, but I (bravely) use Word and Excel for that.

## Things that I need to learn more about

* [ ] What is a Vim Buffer
* [ ] How should I best go about opening a workspace or similar
* [ ] Why have I not included anything in here that is not VIM related.
