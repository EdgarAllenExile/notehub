# ISO42001 & AI Management Systems

## What is ISO 42001?

> “ISO/IEC 42001 is an international standard that specifies requirements for establishing,
> implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an Artificial Intelligence Management System
> (AIMS) within organizations. It is designed for entities providing or utilizing AI-based products or
> services, ensuring responsible development and use of AI systems. ” – ISO

Any orgs that use, develop or work with AI products. The management system that works you move everything under one umbrella.

## Why ISO 42001?

Establishes a system that allows you to ensure you are comfortable with your AI standards. Not prescriptive, but lets you ensure that you are complying with best practices etc.

## Structure

### Normative Requirements

HLS Clause 4-10 and Annex A

Rules and requirements of the ISO standard.

Clauses 1-3 is boilerplate.

#### Clauses 4-10

##### Context of the organisation

1. Understand the organisation and its context
2. Needs and expectations of interested parties
3. Scope of management systems
4. Actually create AI management system

Things such as how the org handles data, how the PII is regulated. Also what the auditor is looking at. Only the single product can be certified, not the entire organisation.

##### Leadership

Anything that is written or approved by AI management policy must have leadership buy in.

##### Planning

Set yourself up for success with regards to how to create a management system. Could include:

- Consideration of the existing frameworks
- Identify and ascertain risks and risk management strats
- Identify risk appetite
- Statement of applicablity (identify parts of existing ISO standard and why / why does not apply)
- Define objectives and plan changes

##### Support

Ensure that your business has the capacity (both bodies and tooling) to achieve goals

Includes the competance of resources and suitability of tooling. Not prescriptive but must show it has been considered.

Communication of ongoing concerns with wider business. 

##### Operation

Running through controls in existing annexures and ensuring that they are covered.

Includes performing initial risk assessments, implementing risk treatments and then doing impact analysis.


##### Performance Evaluation

Ensure monitoring, measurement and analysis.

Conduct internal audits and management review.

##### Improvement

Continually work towards having better management / plans / actions.

Implement corrective action / ensure no non-conformity.

#### Annexure A

Effectively a controls library used to treat risk.

38 controls over 9 control objectives:

    1. General controls
    2. Policies for AI
    3. Internal organisation
    4. Resourcing for AI systems
    5. Assessing impacts of Ai systems
    6. AI systems lifecyle
    7. Data managment
    8. Information for interested parties
    9. Use of AI systems
    10. Third party and custom relationships

### Normative Guidance

Annex B, implementation guidance for annex A

Guidance on how to implement Normative Requirements

### Informative

Annex C, suggestions on risk sources and potential outcomes for orgs

Annex D, use of AI management systems across domains and systems

Nice information about the above.

## PDCA Cycle

Plan, Do, Check, Act cycle.

Plan includes:

- Understand the organisation
- identify stakeholders 

Do includes:

- Implement standards and plan

Check includes:

- Monitor AI systems
- Active involvement in ensuring meeting standards and governance

Act includes:

- Identify areas of concern in system, eg function and performance
- Identify standards and plans that might be improved

## Integrated Management Systems

The standards are set up in such a way that can be combined for a holistic managment system. If you combine the different ISO standards, then you have an IMS.

ISO stanards are created in such a manner that they generally undertake to achieve similar things in similar way. Allows for you to consolidate certain processes and documents.

This can be quicker and easier to implement, audit and accredit than distinct systems.
