# Versioning

## Semantic Versioning

The idea of semantic versioning is that given a three stage version number 0.0.0, you should follow the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH rule. This holds

1. Increment the Major Update Number when you make incompatible changes,
2. Increment the Minor Update Number when you add functionality that is backwards compatible, and
3. Increment the Patch Update Number when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.


There is a lot more on  this, but I am going things and don't have time to read it right now: https://semver.org
