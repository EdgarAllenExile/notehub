# Azure Fundamentals


## Cloud Service Models

There are three models for cloud based infrastructure

1. Private cloud. Onsite and locally hosted by the end user.
2. Public cloud. Hosted by a cloud service provider.
3. Hybrid cloud. A combination thereof\.

### Cost

- Public cloud tends to have the lowest CapEx, since it is only a monthly cost.
- Private cloud tends to have the lowest OpEx, since it is a larger outlay in the beginning.
- Hybrid cloud is of course, somewhere in the middle.

## Cloud Benefits

- Scaleability; Increase machines
- Elastcity; Increase machine capacity
- Reliability; Recover from incidents / load balancing
- Predictability; Know what you are getting yourself into
- Security; Use established providers of cloud services
- Governance; Templatese for consistent device config
- Managability; Ease of use

Elastisity is being able to scale with demand

Agility is being able to pivot with demand

## Cloud service types

- IaaS; Infrastructure as a service
- PaaS; Platform as a service
- SaaS; Software as a service

### Shared responsibility model

Under the shared responsibility model, each party bares differing levels of risk and ownership

## Azure architecture

### Regions

Regions contain atleast 1 data centre

- Some sercives maybe limited by region

### Availability zones

Availability zones are physically seperate data centres within a region

- These availability zones are siloed to ensure stability
- Each region contains atleast three availability zones
- Your resources live within availability zones

### Region Zone Pairs

To ensure stability in the event of a natural disaster, region zones exist in pairs

- Two regions within the same geography
- Usually paired up within the same geographic area
  - West Aus & East Aus as an example

### Sovereign Regions

In special circumstances, some entities may have regions all of their own. These regions are particularly isolated from others.

- The US Government as an example maintains its own sovereign region with comprehensive security
- Azure China also maintains its own Sovereign Zone
  - NB: This zone is maintained by an indepenant third party, to comply with China's data protection laws
- This is through the Azure Government service

## Azure Resources

A general overview of resource management in Azure is as follows:

- Resources are organised into resource groups
  - Resource groups are organised into subscriptions
    - Subscriptions are placed into management groups

All children in the above diagram inherit from their parents, allowing access and settings to be transfered parent to child.

Resources can be created in the portal

### Azure Resource Groups

Within Azure, resources can be grouped in to Resource Groups

- Resources can only have one group at once
  - Meaning they cannot be nested within groups
- Useful Example: Can make a dev resource group and then delete the entire group when these resources are no longer needed
- Resource groups should be restricted to access methods

### Azure Subscriptions

Subscriptions create billing boundries, allowing resources to be allocated between business groups and reported on individually

- Also enables user access to be managed though subscriptions
- Both resources and resource groups are effectively created within a subscription

### Management groups

Management groups can include several different subscription groups

- Intended for high level management

## Azure Compute Services

### Virtual Machines

- Infrastructure as a service
- Includes processing / network / storage / memory
- Can use scale sets to rapidly increase and decrease VMs as needed
- Contain availability sets, which allow you to use update domains and fault domains
  - In combination, this gives allowance for updating while still accounting for any outages

### Virtual Desktops

- Plaform as a service?
- Creates and virtualises a desktop and app interface

### Azure Containers

- Platform as a service
- Container apps allow for the management of micro service on the Azure platform
  - Also enables quick load balancing and other expected services
  - Includes Kubernetes

### Azure Functions

- Platform as a service
- Good for simple and fast actions
- Event based execution
- Serverless

### Azure App Services

- Platform as a service
- Lets you deploy and scale web apps

## Azure Networking

### Azure Virtual Networks

- Allows for connections between Azure services
- Can use network peering to connect different different private networks together
- Can have different public and private endpoints
- Also does standard VPN things
- Can be used with service end points to connect services and resources to Azure

### Azure Express Route

- Similar to a VPN gateway, but is a dedicated connection that is private
- Along with VPN Gateways, are used to connect on prem private networks to Azure resources

### Azure DNS

- Standard phonebook style service

## Azure Storage

Azure offers a remarkable amount of storage options for the discerning gentleperson.

It comes in four flavours of access tier

- Hot, high access and most expensive
- Cool, for data accessed once every thirty days
- Cold, for data accessed once every ninety days
- Archieve, for shit you never want to see again (long term retrieval)

If you would like High Availability however, that you must pay for and is usually dependant on your service level agreement with Microsoft

Storage is allocated against storage accounts, which are a type of resource and can live in a resource group, have a subscription, etc.

### Storage Options

Generally when considering redundancy and integrity there are four options

- Locally redundant storage
  - Datacentre specfic
  - Eleven nines of durability
- Zone redundant storage
  - Spread across three availability zones within a region
  - Twelve nines of durability
- Geo-Redundant storage
  - Basically Locally redundant storage, but paired up over two zones
  - Sixteen nines of durability
- Geo-Zone-Redundant-Storage
  - Basically zone redundant storage across two regions
  - Also sixteen nines of durability

### Storage Services

- Azure Blob; for storing text files, images and backups
- Azure Disk; for virtual disks
- Azure Queue; for messaging services
- Azure Files; for standard file sharing(including SAMBA & NFS)
- Azure Tables; for NOSQL style databases
- Azure SQL; standard SQL DB - PaaS

### Tertiary services

- Azure Migration; Unified platform for data migrations into and out of Azure
- Azure Data Box; Microsoft will send you a big old box with 80tb of storage for you to fill and return to them for them to upload for you

  - Best for big chunky uploads or for uploading into private cloud style opperations
- AzCopy; Command line tool for moving around blobs and files
- Azure Storage Explorer; GUI for all operating systems, used to move files and binary data

  - Uses AzCopy under the hood
- Azure File Sync; Synchronous and bi-directional file sharing

  - Will keep frequently accessed files and ditch others that are not used as much
  - Allows for the rapid reprovisioning of local data

## Identity & Security

Identity Services are largely used with the Entra ID System.

Azure security is a defense in depth style approach to security.

- It is a layered approach, that is it looks something like this
  - Physical security
  - Identity and access
  - Perimeter security
  - Network access
  - Compute
  - Application
  - Data

This is enhanced and enabled through the use of a zero trust standard.

- Zero trust starts with the assumption that there has been a breach and works upwards from there
- Treats all requests as suspicious
- Other Principals
  - Verify requests
  - Least amount of user access as practicable
  - Assume breach in all cicumstances

### Entra ID

Entra ID is a cloud based one stop shop for everything ID related. SSO / MFA and all the things

- Also includes Entra Domains, which allow for access to apps without single sign on capabilities

#### Entra ID Features

Authentication

- EntraID will check that a user is who they claim to be
- Supports SSO, MFA, Passwords, Passphrases the lot
- ID confirmation

Authorisation

- EntraID controls user permissions

Azure MFA

Entra External Identities

- Allows for use of identities from outside of the organisation

Conditional Access

- Brings everything together and allows different forms of access depending on how confident the system is that the person is who they say they are
  - Also allows for smart restricting based on access types

Role based access control

- Scope level access control
- built in to Azure resource manager to provide fine grained control over user access to resources

Entra Connect

- Lets you hook up standard Active Directory with Entra and Azure

### Defender for cloud

- Defender for cloud is a monitoring service that checks resources and alerts with any recommendations on how to improve security or if it has identified any flaws in current policy
  - Based on the Microsoft Security Standards

## Cost management

There are several factors that contribute to the cost of an Azure resource

- Resource type
  - Different resources are different prices
- Consumption
  - Different levels of usage attract different prices
- Maintenance
  - Spinning down unused resources can lower cost
- Geography
  - Regional pricing of various inputs can effect the overall price of an Azure resource
- Network traffic
  - Both inbound and outbound levels of traffic can effect cost
- Subscriptions
  - Different levels of subscriptions come with different levels of software and attract different costs

If you are particularly cost concious, you may wish to deallocate VMs at night. This will enable you to turn off the instance, but still keep relevant data available for when you turn it back on.

Additionally, some resources can be reserved, which lets you get them for cheaper on a long term lease type arrangement.

The Azure Cost Management and Billing area lets you create and manage budgets as well as generate cost reports and cost forecasts

### Azure Marketplace

- Opensource container platform
- Thirdparty offerings and costs, but signed off on by Microsoft

### Pricing Calculator

- Microsoft offers a freely available pricing calculator that allows estimations of cost of provisioning resources
- Allows a business to quickly estmate the cost of transitioning to the cloud
- Includes a total cost of ownership calculator to estimate costs of on prem hardware over its lifecycle
  - Good for convincing management to let you use Azure

### Microsoft Cost Management Tools

- Reporting
- Data Enrichment
- Budgets
- Alerting
- Recommendations

### Resource Tags

- Provide metadata for resources
- Exist in name value pairs
- Not inherited by children

## Governance

### Mirosoft Purview

- Data security and governance tool for management and reporting
- Also includes data classification and other things
- This is where you set Azure Data related policies.
- It is possible that Azure Policy lives within Purview, but I am not 100% on that.

### Azure Policy

- Allows for the creation and setting of org wide standards and assesses compliance with those standards at scale
- Evaluates resources to check compliance
- Policies set will be inherited by an objects children

### Resource locks

- Prevents resources from being modified, created or deleted depending on lock type and applicable user role

### Trust portal

- Publically accessable resources from Microsoft on good governance and security practices
- Includes Microsoft technical documents and third party security professional material

## Developer Tools

There are a variety of standard dev tools that can be used to interact with Azure:

- Azure Portal
- Azure Powershell
- Azure Cloudshell
- Azure CLI Tool

Cloudshell is accessed through a web browser. It allows you to access Azure CLI and Azure Powershell.

### Azure Resource Manager (ARM)

Azure resource manager is a management layer that allows for resource deployment and management.

ARM effectively lets you do anything you need to do with your Azure resources. Including accepting requests from Azure services or an API.

- This can include infrastructure as code and automatic provisioning from templates
  - This can assist with the rapid provisioning required to scale appropriately in response to demand

ARM uses Arm templates

- ARM Templates are in declaritive JSON format that is read when being used to spin up new resources
- ARM Templates can be configured to generate all Azure services

### Azure Arc

Allows for the monitoring of non-Azure services

- Extends the Azure Portal to include on-premises, multi-cloud and other resource monitoring

### Azure Advisor

Azure Advisor makes recommendations on your Azure set up

- Includes tips  on reliability, security and cost

This is probably where you monitor your costs.

### Azure Service Health

Azure service health watches Azure to check the status of its suite of offerings

Approximately split into three tiers

- Azure Status; Global Azure Health
- Service Health; Only shows services and regions you use
- Resource Health; Shows health of your resources

Good place to do root cause analysis!

Health advisories will contain updates and potential outages for your services

### Azure Monitor

Tracks the availability and performance of applications and services. Includes app monitoring and log analysis

Azure Monitor is where you set up checks that will tell you when your VMs have been running at over 80% utilisation for over five minutes.

Will allow for scaling based on resource usage
