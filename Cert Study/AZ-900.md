# Azure Fundamentals

## Cloud Service Models

There are three models for cloud based infrastructure

1. Private cloud. Onsite and locally hosted by the end user.
2. Public cloud. Hosted by a cloud service provider.
3. Hybrid cloud. A combination thereof\.


### Cost 

- Public cloud tends to have the lowest CapEx, since it is only a monthly cost.
- Private cloud tends to have the lowest OpEx, since it is a larger outlay in the beginning.
- Hybrid cloud is of course, somewhere in the middle.
